                <h3>Online Store Front</h3>
                <p>The online store front was the first of many group projects involving myself, Nicholas Goettisheim, and He Qi. 
                    It was our first time working together, and allowed a great experience to get to know each other and each other's strengths. 
                    We all had different roles during the project, allowing us to complete different parts at different rates.
                    Along with being our first time working together, it was our first time using css and html.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overall objective of the site was to lay the framework for an online store. Our store specifically would be used to sell cards online.
                    The site was planned to offer various services, such as an area to enter card information for purchases, 
                    displays for the cards themselves, videos displaying various card, among other things.
