-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE ARE 3 PARTS FOR THE README: First part is the HTML (Activity1) and Second part is the CSS/SASS!!! AND THE FINAL PART IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE!


HTML PART1:
Notes for teacher:
Since I couldn't apply the colors due to it being a wireframe. My personal choice of color would be to be white with box shadow grey for each rectangle section with a background white with black letters.
The projects could have color to make it more vibrant, but the white with a mixture of boxshadow grey would make it have a minimalistic design (sincerity, cleanliness and honesty).

The javaTips.html, htmlTips.html, courseRegistration.html, medicalClinicSystem.html, onlineStoreFront.html and MoveInOn.html are just examples if you click on read more.

Also, the 2-3 in the HTML section in the bibliography are the sites that I got inspired with either with the colors or with the overall design of their portfolio.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSS/SASS PART2:
Although I wanted to make more changes for my site, due to the time restraint, I couldn't do much beside the minimum asked in the PDF file for the activity 2. I would have changed the 3 logo at the bottom for an icon with their respective links if I had more time like we learned in class.

My website was mainly for mobile, although it is optimized with responsive design for desktop. The mobile viewing is much nicer than the desktop in my opinion.

For the coloring, I wanted to make a minimalistic design with white background and black text. However, I felt that there were too many blank space, so I decided to go with blue teal for the header. The other option was to make a gradient color for the main body, but it would ruin what I planned.

Also, I planned to make a hamburger collapse button for mobile, but I saw on some guides
that we needed to use Javascript, so I decided to not implement it. 

1. In the second part, we need to enhance the HTML with advanced layout and styling techniques using CSS by applying
    1. Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)
    2. Grid System Layout
    3. Responsive Design

1. Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)

For the flexbox layout, it is used for the navigation bar and the heading 1, and also
between each of the navigation bar list. It is also used for the contact form where I aligned all the fields to input and centered it in a container (form). It was also used to align different kinds of buttons.

2.  Grid System Layout
For the grid system layout, I mainly applied them for my projects and blogs.
For projects, I split it in 2 for big and medium screen and for blogs, I split it in 3.

3. Combined Layout Techniques
I applied both grid and flexbox throughout my project. (no.1-2)

4. Responsiveness and Adaptability
For the responsive design, I started with mobile, so most of my page is tailored for mobile, then I scale it up for a webpage.
All of the pages are responsive. I added multiple @media for big, medium and small screen.

5. Aesthetic and Functional Enhancements
With SASS, I was able to incorporate different colors and features for buttons (hover),
images, iframes, shadows and different styling.

6. Real-World Project-Specific Goals
6.1Personal Portfolio Website
6.1.1 Create a responsive project gallery using Grid layout.
6.1.2 Align the "About Me" section with Flexbox for readability

Inspirations:
These were listed as the top html sites during a certain year.
They truly are phenomenal in terms of their effect given to the page and the creativity.

Negatives: 
-Sometimes too many colors is distracting
-The text is all over the place (Not that much, but still)

PROJECT PART3
1. Overall Goal
The purpose of the website is to share my passion which is coding, developing, designing and solving different problems. 

2. Purpose of the site
The goal of my website is mainly to showcase my skills, projects and create a blog that I come back to in the further years. It's mainly for myself, but would be fun to have different people read or listen to my blog and check out my projects. Also, it can give an overall impression of my skills and where I am at for the recruiters and managers.

3. Intended Audience 
Myself, people who are interested in different tips/tricks for developers and recruiters.
Adult, kid, anyone interested in my coding journey and tips
Managers, Recruiters

4. Goals of the site
Check on my personal progress
Showcase my skills and what I learned to different people
Advertise myself

5. Desired Outcomes
Get hired and share my passion to others

6. Required Information
All my projects and the blogs I did previously, my personal informations (social media or personal accounts).

7. Opportunity, Problem, or Issue
Different coding problems and the mistakes of a upcoming developer and learning through those. Since I am an aspirant developer, I make mistakes and I learn from them whenever I make new designs since I will always review my past designs and failure to improve them later on. I will usually write those in my blogs which I can convey to the readers about failures and improvement. 

8. Working Titles
